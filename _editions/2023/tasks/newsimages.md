#### Task description

#### Motivation and background

#### Target group
This task targets researchers who are interested in investigating the connection between images and text. This includes people working in the areas of computer vision, recommender systems, cross-modal information retrieval, as well as in the area of news analysis.

#### Data
Details to be added soon.

#### Ground truth
For each text in the test set, the ground truth image is the image with which that text originally appeared online. This information is removed in the test set provided to the participants. 

#### Evaluation methodology
For each text, participants provide a list of N items ranked with decreasing likelihood of being the image originally associated with that text. 

We will compute the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and a set of Precision@K scores with K in {1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}. The average MRR is the official metric of the task. It tells us at what position the linked image appears on average. The average precision scores reveal the performance on different ranks of the list.

#### Quest for insight
Here are several research questions related to this challenge that participants can strive to answer in order to go beyond just looking at the evaluation metrics: 

* In contrast to other vision-language tasks, in this task, the texts do not describe the content depicted in the images. What other kinds of relationships exists between the texts and the images? 
* How distant are embeddings of articles and images in the same space?
* Can we automatically distinguish between stock photos from other images?
* Can we automatically disginguish AI generated images from other images? Do images generated by large AI models play a role?
* What categories of news are easiest/hardest to find the linked image?

#### Participant information
* You are encouraged to release your code for this task. Minimally, you must be able to show you did not match the images by looking up the original source.
* Task registration information will be added here soon.
